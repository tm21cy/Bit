## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
* You can use the default configuration [Prettier](https://prettier.io) comes with.
* Always pull from master before any changes.
* Only use the Prettier formatter.
* Make a new branch for each feature you make. E.g. `feat/ticket-system` if you were adding a tickets system.
* Every Pull Request should have a matching issue.
